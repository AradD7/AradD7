## Hi, I'm Arad
I am a Go and Python developer and recent graduate of the boot.dev, an Archmage might I add. Frontendwise, I have dabbled in react. In addition to Go, python and react, I know C and trying my best to learn French. Currently looking for a full time roll that utilized Go, if you know anyone [message me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/araddelaram/)!
I have also built [Silly Mini Games](https://www.sillyminigames.com), give it a look and let me know what you think!
