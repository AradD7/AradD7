### Hi, I'm Arad
I am a Go and Python developer and recent graduate of [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) (an **_Archmage_** might I add). Frontend-wise, I have dabbled in React. In addition to Go, Python and React, I know C and am trying my best to learn French. Currently looking for a full-time roll that utilizes Go, if you know anyone [message me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/araddelaram/)!

I have also built [Silly Mini Games](https://www.sillyminigames.com), take a look and let me know what you think!
